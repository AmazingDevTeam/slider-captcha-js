## [1.0.7] - 2025-10-03
### Changed
- Bumped version to **1.0.7** (`chore(release)`).
- Added `export type { SliderCaptchaRef }` in `src/index.ts` so TypeScript consumers can import the ref type directly from the package entry point.
- Rebuilt distribution bundles (`dist/slider-captcha.esm.js`, `dist/react-slider-captcha.esm.js`, etc.).
- Updated README.md:
  - Clarified React usage examples for both JavaScript (`.jsx`) and TypeScript (`.tsx`).
  - Added example showing how to use `SliderCaptchaRef` with `useRef` in TypeScript.
  - Ensured JavaScript example uses plain `useRef(null)` without type import.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-29
### Fixed
- Fixed slider not draggable on Safari 18.4 (macOS).
- Replaced `instanceof TouchEvent` checks with feature detection (`"touches" in e`) to avoid runtime errors on Safari desktop.
- Ensured `preventDefault()` is only called when event is cancelable, improving Safari compatibility.
- Verified cross-browser drag support (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
